This Wavelet and Multiscale Library is a collection of basis-oriented algorithms that use ansatz systems with multiscale structure, like finite elements, wavelets, shearlets and other such dictionaries. It is divided into differrent software packages, with the main focus on the
[Marburg Software Library](aboutmsl) (MSL). ![dual_a.jpg]({{site.baseurl}}/img/dual_a.jpg){:height="36px" width="36px"}

It outlines the programm code developed over the years by the AG Numerik Uni Marburg. Specific explanation of the code and theoretical background can be found at the respective menu items.
