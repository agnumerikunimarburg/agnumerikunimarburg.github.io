This Wavelet and Multiscale Library is a collection of adaptive wavelet algorithms for partial differential equations, complemented by some additional wavelet tools. <img style="float: right;" src="/img/dual_a.jpg" height="300" width="300">It is divided into differrent software packages, with the main focus on the [Marburg Software Library](aboutmsl) (MSL).  
It outlines the programm code developed over the years by the AG Numerik, Philipps-Universit√§t Marburg. Specific explanation on the code and the theoretical background can be found at the corresponding menu items. The development has partially been supported by the DFG priority program 1324 "Extraction of Quantifiable Information from Complex Systems".
