<img style="float: left;" src="/img/Logo-DFG-SPP1324.png" height="89" width="180">_Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft_: [DFG Priority Program 1324](http://www.dfg-spp1324.de/?lang=en)  
Mathematical models of complex systems form the foundation for further technological developments in science, engineering and computational finance. A deeper understanding of the mathematical foundations as well as the development of new and efficient numerical algorithms are the main goals of this DFG Priority Program.


### Participants
